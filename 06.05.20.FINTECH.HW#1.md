# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

MakerDao

The company was founded in 2014, headquartered in Santa Cruz, CA.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Rune Christensen

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
 
MakerDao is a decentralized organization that exists within the Ethereum community, or as they describe themselves "A global, open-source platform for decentralized applications." Where, "You can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world." Or more simply, "The world's programmable blockchain." The digital value they reference is based in Ether, the naitive crypto currency of Ethereum.

Within the Ethereum universe, MakerDao 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Funding has come from 4 rounds, totaling $27 million. Sources have included pre-seed, venture capital as well as private equity.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

MakerDao was created a solution that seeks to address two fundamental challenges with the use of a crypto currency as a financing tool. Specifically, MakerDao seeks to address : 1) volatility associated with the novel concept (relative to legacy Finance) of crypto currency, & also 2) the lack of infrastructure supporting crypto currency as a channel within the lending industry. To address these challenges MakeerDao uses a stable-coin crypto currency (Dai) as the foundation to an asset backed lending platform, all based upon the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is created when collateralized by Ether (ETH), the native currency of Ethereum. Further, MakerDao seeks to minimize price volatility of Dai against the IMF's SDR currency basket.  

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

In theory MakerDao's intended customer is any indvidual, company or institution that desires fiancnaing, but may not have access (or a desire to) access traditional lending channels. This would mean companies that have exhausted traditional fiancing options, practically speaking, ones that are in a weak position to seek funding. The other group that does not have a desire to access traditional financing channels are those who do not want to provide details about their underlying business or personal details. Think an eccentric billionaire who has a distaste for banks, or the Sinaloa Cartel. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

MakerDao has created a novel platform for collateralized lending using their stable crypto currency, Dai.  The product is described as a Collateralized Debt Position ("CDP). Ether are used as collateral, at no less than 1.5x the value that is being financed. I believe this is a requirement driven by the price volatility of Ether, as MakerDao seeks to minimize price volatility of Dai relative to the IMF's SDR currency basket. This is accomplished through monetary policy actions, using Maker Dao's regulatory currency / coin MKR.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

MakerDao's project can be classified as 'Alternative Finance'

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

In the past 10 years, cryto currencies have gone from a speculative (& largely unknown) quantity, to a bastion of fraud & money laundering activities, to a potential long-term expansion of the global financial industry through their advantages of settlment, liquidity & accessibility. Although little progress has been made (to the best of my research) to use a decentralized crypto currency as a source for traditional lending, which has been a function of both price volatility & a lack of lending infrastructure. 

A principle attribute of previous "stable coins" is that they have been tied to a legacy fiat currency, and by extension the currency's government & regulatory system, i.e. centralized. MakerDao seeks to keep Dai stable, but decentralized, & has also started to establish a true lending platform.  

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

I haven't found a company that competes directly with MakerDao, specifically an asset backed lending platform leveraging a stable coin. However, there are several companies/projects that compete tangentially. Specifically, Salt - which is an asset backed lending platform, of which, the product's downside is that collateral required comes in the form of various crypto currencies at a rate of 2.0x the loan value with the borrower also incurring a lending fee (interest rate) of 15-20% per year. Compare this to structure to the unsecured debt available to most US citizens through credit cards & the drawbacks are apparent. There are also several stable coins (Tether, etc.) currently in use, but they typically seek to maintain reserves equaling 1:1 (though not always the case) to the fiat currency they are pegged to. Tether, for example, has run into issues maintaining its reputation as a financial product that is, in fact, pegged to the US$, as cash reserves were well below the 1:1 ratio. Furthermore, Tether has heretofore failed to produce satisfactory audits to provide confidence in the product.   


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

I consider MakerDao to be a pilot that demonstrates that a decentralized stable coin can be used in collateralized lending. While there are many flaws that still exist, I see the MakerDao project as a significant proof-of-life of the concept. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

If this is to be treated (judged) like a traditional lending platform, the primary metrics would include the amount of capital deployed, the capital at risk & the income generated through lending activites.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Difficult to tell, given the overall lack of transparency around the decentralized nature of the product/industry. However, I have noticed that MakerDao has thus far been able to steer relatively clear of negative press that has plagued many industry players. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Crypto currency provides the "future-state vision" which frees the borrowing community from the shackles of the status quos within the existing industry. Think no questions asked, no KYC, etc., however these measures are in place to evaluate the borrower's credit worthiness to provide the borrower with the lowest possible financing rate & lowest collateral value required. In addition, the price volatility of crypto currency vs. a fiat currency has historically been much higher due to the nascency of the product. Both of these issues contribute to the high collateralization rate required, right now no less than 1.5x the amount financed, as well as the highly volatile Borrowing/Savings Rate(s). This general sense of volatility of the product, combined with the risk of fraud or theft as compared to the existing infrastructure are the two fundamental issues that MakerDao, or any other crypto currency, will need to address. I am fully aware that the evolution of crypto currencies will take time, but the sooner these issues can be addressed, the sooner the product(s) will be adopted.

My recommendations would center around ways to stabilize the value of both the currency and the collateral. In practice, the first step would be to expand the nature & type of collateral accepted to create Dai (beyond Ether). Second (& more difficult) step would be to look at ways to further stabilize the Dai currency, which is governed by a separate regulatory currency, MKR.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
- Increasing the breadth & depth of collateral accepted will help to reduce price volatility, which in turn would help to reduce the collateralization rate.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
- Potentially utilize PolkaDot's capability to allow different blockchain technologies to work together. Also, I would look into SALT to determine if they have any competitive advantage in blockchain backed loans.   

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
- Their competitive advantage appears to address areas of weakness. However, I would need significantly more time to research specifics.
