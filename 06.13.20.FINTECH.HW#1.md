# MakerDao Case Study
* Eric Siebert, Rice FinTech, 06.13.20

## Overview and Origin

#### Name of company

* MakerDao

#### When was the company incorporated?

* The company was founded in 2014, headquartered in Santa Cruz, CA.

#### Who are the founders of the company?

* Rune Christensen

#### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
 
* MakerDao is a decentralized organization that exists within the Ethereum community, or as they describe themselves "A global, open-source platform for decentralized applications." Where, "You can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world." Or more simply, "The world's programmable blockchain." The digital value they reference is based in Ether, the native crypto currency of Ethereum. 

#### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

* Funding has come from 4 rounds, totaling $27 million. Sources have included pre-seed, venture capital as well as private equity.

## Business Activities:

#### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* MakerDao created a solution that seeks to address two fundamental challenges with the use of a crypto currency as a financing tool. Specifically, MakerDao seeks to address : 1) volatility associated with crypto currency as an emerging store of value, & also 2) the lack of infrastructure supporting crypto currency as a lending channel within Finance. To address these challenges MakeerDao uses a stable-coin crypto currency (Dai) as the foundation to an asset backed lending platform, based upon the Ethereum blockchain. Additional Dai can be created when collateralized by Ether (ETH), the native currency of Ethereum. Dai are retired when the loan is repaid & the ETH are released. Further, MakerDao seeks to minimize price volatility of Dai against the IMF's SDR currency basket. Monetary policy is enacted through voting rights assigned to a regulatory currency MKR, in essence a decentralized Federal Reserve.

#### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* In theory MakerDao's intended customer is any indvidual, company or institution that desires financing, but may not have access (or a desire to access) traditional lending channels. This would mean companies that have exhausted traditional financing options, ones in a weak financial position to seek funding. The would also be other group that do not want to provide details about their underlying business, it's assets or relationships. An eccentric billionaire or the Sinaloa Cartel. 

#### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* MakerDao has created a novel platform for collateralized lending using their stable crypto currency, Dai.  The product is described as a Collateralized Debt Position ("CDP). As a lending product, ETH are used as collateral - at no less than 1.5x the value financed. I believe the excess collateralization rate is a requirement driven by the price volatility of Ether, as it is not a stable coin. MakerDao seeks to minimize price volatility of Dai relative to the IMF's SDR currency basket. This is accomplished through monetary policy actions, set by holders of Maker Dao's regulatory coin, MKR.

#### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
* From what I can gather, they are utilizing Distributed Ledger Technology, ("DLT") on the blockchain. Precisely how they DLT on the blockchain is still unclear to me, but I am interested in better understanding this relationship. What I have gathered is that at its core, all blockchains are distributed ledgers, but not all distributed ledgers are blockchains.

> "With the blockchain form of DLT, an organization’s ledger is distributed (shared) across a wide network of devices called nodes, and each node possesses the exact same information. Every ledger transaction is added to a chain and authenticated, effectively creating an audit trail that’s transparent, traceable, and accessible to all. Transactions are also unmodifiable, for the most part. Only in the case of a blockchain re-org or a fork can some recent blocks can be replaced." 

> "Furthermore, and most crucial, DLT is often decentralized (no one person or entity controls the data), so it’s “trustless.” In other words, there’s no central authority to trust. Security is all but guaranteed, too, through software code, complicated encryption, and digital signatures."

## Landscape:

#### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* MakerDao's project can be classified as 'Alternative Finance,' namely a new way for a counterparty to access capital. 

#### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* In the past 10 years, crypto currencies have gone from a speculative (& largely unknown) quantity, to a suspected bastion of fraud & money laundering, to a potential long-term expansion of the global financial industry's market through their advantages of quick settlement, relative liquidity & increased accessibility. Although little progress has been made (to the best of my research) to use a decentralized stable coin (crypto currency) as a source for asset-backed lending, a function of both price volatility & lack of lending infrastructure. 

* A principle attribute of previous "stable coins" is that they have been tied to fiat currency, and by extension the currency's government & regulatory system, i.e. centralized. MakerDao seeks to keep Dai stable, but decentralized, & has also started to establish the beginnings of a bonafide lending platform.  

#### What are the other major companies in this domain?

* I haven't found a company that competes directly with MakerDao, specifically an asset backed lending platform that leverages a stable coin with monetary policy driven by a corresponding regulatory crypto currency. HOWEVER, there are several companies/projects that compete tangentially. Specifically, Salt - which is an asset backed lending platform, of which, the product's downside is that collateral is accepted in the form of various crypto currencies at a rate of no less 2.0x the loan value, in addition to a lending fee (interest rate) of 15-20% per year. Compare this structure to the unsecured debt available to most US citizens through credit cards or LOCs & the drawbacks are apparent. There are also several stable coins (Tether, etc.) currently in use, but they have often struggled to maintain reserves equaling 1:1 (though not always the case) to the fiat currency they are pegged to. Tether, for example, has run into issues maintaining its reputation as a financial product that is, in fact, pegged to the US$, as cash reserves were found to be well below the 1:1 ratio. Furthermore, Tether has heretofore failed to produce satisfactory audits to provide confidence in the product.   


## Results

#### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* I consider MakerDao to be a pilot that demonstrates a decentralized stable coin can be used as a based of collateralized lending. While many flaws still exist, I see the MakerDao project as a significant proof-of-life of the concept. 

#### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* If this is to be treated (judged) like a traditional lending platform, the primary metrics would include the amount of capital deployed, the capital at risk & the income generated through lending activites.
* I would also look at the stability of the Dai Savings rate, of which forecasting will be crucial to building trust in the Maker Protocol & the crypto currency.

#### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

* Difficult to tell, given the overall lack of transparency around the decentralized nature of the product/industry. However, I have noticed that MakerDao has thus far been able to steer relatively clear of negative press that has plagued a number of industry participants. 

## Recommendations

#### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

* Crypto currency provides the "future state vision" which frees the borrowing community from the shackles of status quo dogma. Think no questions asked, no KYC, no Banana Republic administration to destabilize the currency, etc. However unpleasant, these measures are often in place to provide stability (faith) in the system & to evaluate the borrower's credit worthiness. This credibility works both ways & benefits the borrower by providing the lowest possible financing rate & collateral required. In addition, price volatility of crypto currency vs. a fiat currency has historically been much greater due to the nascency of the product. Both of these issues contribute to the high collateralization rate required, right now no less than 1.5x the amount financed, as well as the highly volatile Borrowing/Savings Rate(s). This general sense of volatility of the product, combined with the risk of fraud or theft as compared to the existing infrastructure (at least in the US) are the two fundamental issues that MakerDao, or any other crypto currency will need to address. I am fully aware that the evolution of crypto currencies will take time, but the sooner these issues can be addressed, the sooner the product(s) will be adopted & begin to realize their addressable market.

* My recommendations would center around ways to stabilize the value of both the currency and the value of collateral used to create more Dai. In practice, the first step would be to expand the nature & type of collateral accepted to create Dai (beyond Ether). 

* The second (& admittedly much more difficult) step would be to look at ways to further stabilize the Dai currency, which is governed by a separate regulatory currency, MKR. Holders of the MKR coins (1M were originally created) set the monetary policy for Dai. The MKR regulatory coin was chosen as the method to keep the Dai decentralized. So instead of placing trust in a country's Central Bank or government to responsibly control monetary policy, trust is placed in the holders of MKR to make policy decisions. MKR is the regulatory coin connected with Dai. Specifically, the holders of MKR set the Dai savings rate, control the money supply (specifically, how much overall Dai is in ciruculation), and also manage the peg of Dai to fiat currency. Currently, the Maker Protocol is the defining manifesto/architecture used to manage policy. In order to build trust within this regulatory/decision making body, & by extension the Dai crypto currency, I would look to further expand on the Maker Protocol. Specifically, further expansion of strategic obectives & guiding principles to build trust (faith) in the currency. The proposition that Dai (or any crypto currency makes) is a decoupling of value (& value drivers) from an existing financial insitution, industry or government. This value proposition resonates when comparing Dai to local currency in Zimbabwe or Venezuela, two countries marred by hyper inflation from mismanagement, fraud & waste. However, this is not the case when comparing Dai to USD, GBP or EUR. USD is still the world's most stable form of currency, witnessed time & again during periods of global econominc uncertainty, specifically when there is a "flight to quality" of wealth transferred into US dollars & investment securities. This is due to the high level of inherent trust placed in the FOMC, a committee within the US Federal Reserve that oversees interest rates on US Treasury (upon which all other interests rates in Financial Services are based) as well as the US money supply. I'm not suggesting that cryto currencies will ever want or need to strive to introduce such rigors (i.e. dogma) into their monetary policies. My point is that there needs to be significant improvement upon the current state of policy infrastructure to truly build momentum & trust in the crypto space. Case in point, the Dai savings rate (set by the holders of MKR) has recently fluctuated from 0% to 15% & back again in a matter of months. That type of instability (i.e. volatility), driven largely by a lack of transparency into the guiding principles & decision making of those holding MKR, will be a deterrant to trust & growth. Said another way, if transparency does not lead to an ability to better forecast value (i.e. expected return), it isn't providing value to the customer & the competitive advantages of decentralization or ties to existing Finance.    

#### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* Increasing the breadth & depth of collateral accepted will help to reduce price volatility, which in turn would help to reduce the collateralization rate.

#### What technologies would this additional product or service?
* Potentially PolkaDot's capability to allow different blockchain technologies to work together. Also, I would look into SALT to determine if they have any competitive advantage in blockchain backed loans. With regards to the Maker Protocol changes, I would hire one (or more) economists, preferrably graduates from the University of Chicago (ha!) who have had experience working at one of the Federal Reserve Banks.    

#### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
* Their competitive advantage appears to address areas of MakerDao's weakness. However, I would need significantly more time to research specifics.
